# climate-api

small and simple api for climate change built for education/practice
with nodejs and javascript  

in order to run the API you need to install the required node modules
in your terminal by running the commands: npm i express,
                                          npm i axios,
                                          npm i cheerio,
                                          npm i nodemon.


In the package.json file i have included a built in nodemon function to initialize the server
by running the command: npm run start, once your sever is up, use any web browser and navigate to the URL: localhost:8888/news to view the content/data.

I am pretty much finished with this project at this point, I may come back at some point, and add some styling and functionality features with html and css.
